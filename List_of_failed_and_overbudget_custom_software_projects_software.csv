The air force was operating at a 70% capacity, another area was reported to operate at a 3% capacity with half of the staff not able to work at all. It would take up to a year to restore capacity.[17][18] At this point the cost to scrap the project and develop a new one was estimated to be SEK 11bn ($1.3bn). Not seen as an alternative, the development continued and the original budget of SEK 2.4bn was increased to 4bn.[19] In 2015 the project was still on its way to be fully implemented.",SEK 4bn ($470m)[20] (ongoing),Technical aspects outsourced

A significant portion of this spend was composed of contracting fees to IBM[23] and Fujitsu.[24] As of early 2016, business take up of electronic reporting was 2-3%. Program has also suffered from significant scope creep[25] and confused objectives.[26] It is likely that choice of XBRL as the reporting format is the main driver behind low take-up (due to its obscurity and high implementation cost [27][28][29] relative to other technical standards).",~$1bn to date (ongoing),Technical aspects outsourced
